In this project, we design a wearable hand rehabilitation robot, which consists of a data glove, a manipulator and an APP. This system allows the patient to use a healthy hand to operate the rehabilitation glove, thus controlling the robot to drive the disabled hand to reproduce its movements. At the same time, combined with the rehabilitation program customized by professional physicians integrated into the APP, the system can provide corresponding rehabilitation training for different degrees of disability.
